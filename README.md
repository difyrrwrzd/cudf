# libgdf: GPU Dataframes

[![Build Status](http://18.191.94.64/buildStatus/icon?job=libgdf-master)](http://18.191.94.64/job/libgdf-master/)

libgdf is a C library for implementing common functionality for a GPU Data Frame.  For more project details, see [the wiki](https://github.com/gpuopenanalytics/libgdf/wiki/Home).

## Development Setup

The following instructions are tested on Linux and OSX systems.

Compiler requirement:

* `g++` 4.8 or 5.4
* `cmake` 3.12+

CUDA requirement:

* CUDA 9.0+

You can obtain CUDA from [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

### Get dependencies

**Note**: This repo uses submodules. Make sure you cloned recursively:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:gpuopenanalytics/libgdf.git
```

Or, after cloning:

```bash
cd libgdf
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Since `cmake` will download and build Apache Arrow (version 0.7.1) you may 
need to install Boost C++ (version 1.58) before running `cmake`:

```bash
# Install Boost C++ 1.58 for Ubuntu 16.04
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

or

```bash
# Install Boost C++ 1.58 for Conda (you will need a Python 3.3 environment)
$ conda install -c omnia boost=1.58.0=py33_0
```

You can install Boost C++ 1.58 from sources as well: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html

To run the python tests it is recommended to setup a conda environment for 
the dependencies.

```bash
# create the conda environment (assuming in build directory)
$ conda env create --name libgdf_dev --file ../conda_environments/dev_py35.yml
# activate the environment
$ source activate libgdf_dev
$ conda install arrow-cpp=0.7.1 -c conda-forge
$ conda install pyarrow=0.7.1 -c conda-forge
```

This installs the required `cmake` and `pyarrow` into the `libgdf_dev` conda
environment and activates it.

For additional information, the python cffi wrapper code requires `cffi` and
`pytest`.  The testing code requires `numba` and `cudatoolkit` as an
additional dependency.  All these are installed from the previous commands.

The environment can be updated from `../conda_environments/dev_py35.yml` as
development includes/changes the depedencies.  To do so, run:

```bash
conda env update --name libgdf_dev --file ../conda_environments/dev_py35.yml
```

### Configure and build

This project uses cmake for building the C/C++ library. To configure cmake,
run:

```bash
mkdir build   # create build directory for out-of-source build
cd build      # enter the build directory
cmake ..      # configure cmake (will download and build Apache Arrow and Google Test)
```

To build the C/C++ code, run `make`.  This should produce a shared library
named `libgdf.so` or `libgdf.dylib`.

If you run into compile errors about missing header files:

```bash
cub/device/device_segmented_radix_sort.cuh: No such file or directory
```

See the note about submodules in the Get dependencies section above.

### Link python files into the build directory

To make development and testing more seamless, the python files and tests
can be symlinked into the build directory by running `make copy_python`.
With that, any changes to the python files are reflected in the build
directory.  To rebuild the libgdf, run `make` again.

### Run tests

Currently, all tests are written in python with `py.test`.  A make target is
available to trigger the test execution.  In the build directory (and with the
conda environment activated), run below to exceute test:

```bash
make pytest   # this auto trigger target "copy_python"
```
